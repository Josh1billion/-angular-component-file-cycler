# Angular Component File Cycler

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fordesoft.angular-component-file-cycler

This allows you to switch between similarly-named Angular component files with an easy shortcut.

For example, if you have hello.component.ts open, you can activate this extension (press Ctrl+K, then Ctrl+O without ever releasing Ctrl) to tell VS Code to open hello.component.html.  Activating it again will open the corresponding scss/css/sass/less file.  Activating it once more will open the corresponding ts file again.
